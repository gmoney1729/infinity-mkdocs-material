### Fill Holes

It is possible to fill holes in the surfaces when the holes in the surface are created but the surface should be continuous.

Multiple holes can be selected in one hole filling event. The hole is filled in the same fill interpolation parameter within the same fill holes event.

Fill Interpolation Parameter

**Fill Interpolation Parameter**

This setting defines how holes in the surface are filled. The level of interpolation considers the surrounding surface geometry to determine how to fill the holes and how well to fit to the surrounding surface. With no interpolation, straight triangles between hole vertices are created, with no interpolated vertices. When applying levels of interpolation results in more vertices within the holes to be filled.
