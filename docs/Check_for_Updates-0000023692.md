# Check for Updates

### Check for Updates

Periodically, Infinity updates are made available for download and installation. These updates can include new releases with new modules or new features. Updates can also include maintenance releases with software patches.

You can check for updates from the About menu under the File tab, or have the checks made automatically on start-up. Updates can be downloaded from myWorld@leica-geosystems.com, the Leica Geosystems customer information portal.

To get the most from any new updates for Infinity, it is recommended to have a current Leica Geosystems Customer Care Package (CCP). With an active CCP, access to all software updates including new releases is available.

For users who do not have administrator rights on their computer, the Check for Update message only informs of available updates. The files required for any update must be downloaded and installed by your IT department or a person with administrative rights for that computer.
