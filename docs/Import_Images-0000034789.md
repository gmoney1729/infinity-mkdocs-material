When the Create Image Group box is checked, an image group is created directly after closing the import dialog. In order to be processed, images must be added to an image group. If no image group is created on import, one can be created after the import and images can be added to it. For further information, see Image Group.

By default, this setting is checked. However, if unchecked, Infinity remembers the selection at the following import.

When the Import Images box is checked the images are copied to the project. If this option is unchecked, the images are not copied into the project but linked to it through the path specified in the import dialog. If, after importing, the images are deleted or moved to a different path, no processing is allowed. A warning message is displayed if the images cannot be found at the expected location.
