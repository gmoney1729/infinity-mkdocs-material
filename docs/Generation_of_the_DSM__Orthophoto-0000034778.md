# Generation of the DSM & Orthophoto

### Generation of the DSM & Orthophoto

To create a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophoto from an image group, do the following:

**To create a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and an orthophoto from an image group, do the following:**

| 1. | Highlight the image group. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Select DSM & Orthophoto from the Imaging ribbon bar or from the context menu. |
| 3. | To store the DSM & orthophoto result, highlight the result and select Store from the Imaging ribbon bar or from the context menu. |

To remove a stored DSM & orthophoto result, do the following:

To create a report for the DSM & orthophoto, do the following:

**To create a report for the DSM & orthophoto, do the following:**

If the images are not oriented or the previous step is computed but not stored. An orientation is computed first, then a dense point cloud is created, based on the computed orientation. Finally a DSM & orthophoto is created, based on the computed orientation and the dense point cloud. It is equivalent to running a onestep process. For further information, see Image Processing.

The DSM is used to create orthophotos but can also be used to compare between different models.

Orthophotos can be used as background maps in Infinity. They can also be exported to onboard software, to Leica ConX, as well as to third party software.
