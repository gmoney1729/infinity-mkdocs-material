### OpenStreetMap

Infinity supports the OpenStreetMap service. Also referred to as OSM.

**Requirements:**

- Valid Infinity maintenance Customer Care Package (CCP).

This service provides a backdrop to your Infinity projects which is a nice way to help visualise, reference and relate your project data. It provides open source maps that can be loaded, displayed in a project and with the Clip Base Map function, downloaded as a georeferenced image and available for export to the field software. This service is provided free of charge for Infinity customers having an active CCP. The software reads from the Infinity Electronic Identification (EID) licence the information about the maintenance period. When the maintenance period has expired, no access is available to the OpenStreetMap service.
