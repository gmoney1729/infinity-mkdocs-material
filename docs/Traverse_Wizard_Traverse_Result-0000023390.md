# Traverse Wizard: Traverse Result

### Traverse Wizard: Traverse Result

Before you take over the computation results to your project, the calculation results are listed.

Method: Compass Rule, Transit Rule

**Method: Compass Rule, Transit Rule**

You see:

**You see:**

- The total traverse length.
- The number of stations included.
- The achieved 1D and 2D accuracy (if the misclosure is zero these fields are dashed).
- The misclosure point.
- The misclosure values after adjustment.
- The calculated scale.Select **Apply scale to observations** if you want to apply the scale factor resulting from the traverse computation to all setups that make up the traverse. For each setup, all observations are scaled with this value.
- The kind of error distribution (balancing) you have chosen for angles and height.
- Transformation values applied as a result of point resourcing (based on start station and initial azimuth).
- The adjusted results calculated for the traverse point coordinates using the control coordinates at the start (and the end) of the traverse plus the Δ values in position and height relative to the coordinates resulting internally from the measurements.How large the Δ values are depends on how you choose to distribute the errors in Step 4: Calculate Traverse.

To apply the results and update the traverse point coordinates in your project:

The    adjusted coordinates should be taken as target coordinates when recalculating setups on sideshot points of the traverse.
