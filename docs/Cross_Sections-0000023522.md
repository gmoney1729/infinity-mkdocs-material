# Cross Sections

### Cross Sections

Within Infinity cross sections can be imported or manually created. Manually created cross sections are always stored as a template and are as such available for roads.

Imported cross sections are not stored as a template automatically, but you can copy them to a new cross section template.

Cross Section Assignments

If available as a template, a cross section can be selected to be assigned to a road from the list in the Cross Sections tab of the Infrastructure Manager.

Assigned cross sections can be edited and if available as a template your changes can be updated to the template for further use.
