# Code Group

### Code Group

Code groups are the primary building blocks of a code table and describe groups of objects, which have a common theme. For example, utilities, vegetation, buildings or roads. Grouping helps to manage codes by activating or deactivating groups on board the instrument.

A code table may have as many code groups as you define. Each code group then has subcomponents known as codes and attributes.

Code group names may be up to 16 characters long and may consist of alphanumeric characters.

You can add new code groups, modify existing code groups and Delete code groups.
