# Refined

### Refined

Creates a 3D surface. Use this method for clean point cloud data that is constant in density.

- Uses the meshing parameters and then refines the mesh to generate the most detail.

The surface is created following these steps:

- Determines the initial mesh using the minimum triangle size (regular sampling) and the maximum triangle size (hole detection).
- Fills holes without adding new points and without using curvature filling.
- Refines the mesh adding triangles where the deviation between the point cloud and the initial mesh is greater than 0.01Â m.
- Removes spikes to smooth the final mesh.
