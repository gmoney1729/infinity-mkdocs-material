# Alignment Objects

### Alignment Objects

Each road and tunnel object needs at least one alignment object which serves as the centreline.

The centreline is the main line in a road or tunnel model. It is the reference axis that determines the distance along the road or tunnel (chainage) and across it (offsets).

All alignments available in a project are grouped and listed in the navigator and the inspector.
