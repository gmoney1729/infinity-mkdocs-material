# Quick Ground

### Quick Ground

Quick ground allows the transformation from local grid to ground coordinates, based on a selected coordinate system. A ground coordinate system considers the geometric scaling that must be applied to horizontal distances. The scaling reflects the position relative to the grid origin of the local coordinate system and the elevation of the points.

A ground scale factor can be either entered manually (if known) or by selecting a known point.

The coordinates of the base point can be kept fixed during the transformation. If necessary, more shifts can be applied to the horizontal (false Easting and false Northing) and vertical coordinates (height shift). It is only allowed to apply a height shift to a ground coordinate system, when the attached geoid is a local geodetic (not grid) model.
