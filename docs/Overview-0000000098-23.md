# Overview

### Reduce Foresights Wizard

The reduce foresights wizard reduces a sequence of TPS observations from a common TPS setup.

Each foresights application is using the station setup backsight target point as the starting reference to compute the foresight targets. This is different to the sets of angles application which references the first target to reference the reduced angles.

The reduced foresights also result with a reduced observation.
