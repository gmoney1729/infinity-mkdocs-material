# Leica Infinity Docs (unofficial)

!!! danger "Unofficial"

    This is an unofficial port of Leica Infinity's documentation. It is not in sync with the officially published documentation. Use at your own risk. All copyrights held by their respective owners.

This personal project uses [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) which is a theme extension of static site generator [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org). It is an attempt to create a modern documentation for Leica Infinity. It does not intend to serve as the go-to Infinity help. Please refer to help included in your software installer.

This unofficial port is in its very early stages where the content from official help has just been extracted and rendered here with basic styling. Most of the styling and layout of contents from official docs has been lost during the extraction process. You will notice incorrectly formatted and positioned images, tables, lists, etc. Work is in progress to apply decent styling and layout. 

Feedback is welcome. Last updated on Oct 4, 2024.
