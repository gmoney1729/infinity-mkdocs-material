# Checked Points

### Checked Points

The checked points subtab lists allÂ the points measured in the field with Captivate using the checked point application.

Points with at least one of the checked values out of tolerance, are indicated with an exclamation mark. You can find out more information about the out of tolerance values, by hovering the mouse over the icon with the exclamation mark.

Infinity can create Reports for the checked points application results.
