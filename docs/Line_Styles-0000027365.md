# Line Styles

### Line Styles

Line style is a visual property that can be assigned to geometric objects. Line styles can be for example a pattern of dashes, dots or text.

Line styles are defined in a line style definition LIN file. You can import the line styles from the LIN file and use them with your codes.

The line style functionality is not supported in SmartWorx Viva or Captivate. Therefore, line styles are not exported to the codelist. Collect your data as normal and assign the code table to the project for the correct style representation.

Line style names are case-sensitive. During an import, line styles with the same name are overwritten.
