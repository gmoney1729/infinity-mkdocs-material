# Overview

### Imaging

Images are a useful way to add context to your project data. Infinity supports working with images in a project for documentation, along with computing points from images where measured data may have been overlooked during field collection. In Reality Capture, images can be used for generating dense point clouds, providing a detailed 3D perspective to a project area and allowing you to extract or create 3D features and data deliverables.

Infinity supports the import of images from SmartWorx and Captivate field jobs, Aibot UAV, other fixed and rotary wing drones and general JPG images. It is also possible to import georeferenced images to display as background maps.

In imaging you get access to:
