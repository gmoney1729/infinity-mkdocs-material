# Layer Manager

### Layer Manager

When you import data into an Infinity project, it is automatically organised into layers. Each layer is given a name in relation to its status and a pre-defined graphical representation. Each layer consists of a pre-defined colour, line style and shading style of the elements that belong to a layer. In the layer manager, you can change the status (on/off, locked/unlocked) and the graphical settings.

Survey data layers:

**Survey data layers:**

All surveyed data is organised in layers. On the survey layers, you can find all the Infinity objects that are imported as field data from SmartWorx (DBX) jobs or HeXML files. Survey layers can be exported to *.dxf, *.dwg, *.xml or *.HeXML files.

Survey data layers:

**Survey data layers:**

On these layers, the survey data is grouped by object type.

Thematic layers

**Thematic layers**

All feature codes are organised in layers. On a thematic layer, the thematic information of feature objects like points, lines or areas are grouped. The thematic layers can be exported to *.dxf or *.dwg.

Thematic layers can either be edited directly in the code manager or in the layer manager. You can also create new thematic layers from inside the layer manager. In both cases, the code table is updated accordingly.

To create new layers in the layer manager:

**To create new layers in the layer manager:**

Select the    New Layer option in the top right corner and define the new layer through inline editing and selecting features from the drop-down list in each column. The layer name can also be changed through inline editing.

Reference layers

**Reference layers**

Under Reference Layers you can find all the layers as defined in referenced files like imported *.dxf or *.dwg files or *.ifc files. For those layers, you can also change the appearance, switch layers on/off or lock/unlock them, without having to modify the source files themselves.

Defining the graphical settings:

**Defining the graphical settings:**

To redefine the graphical appearance of a layer (for example, the colour of the point symbols or the line style of an area boundary) you can modify the line colour, its width and style as well as shading colour and style of area objects.

Excluding layers from export:

**Excluding layers from export:**

Most of the layers can separately be excluded from export.

In the Export column, select the    option to exclude a layer from being exported.
