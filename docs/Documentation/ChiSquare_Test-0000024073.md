# Chi-Square Test

### Chi-Square Test

Unlike the F-Test used in the B-Method of testing, the Chi-Square is a two-tailed test, that is, it tests the Chi-Square value against both the upper and the lower bound.

In practice, if the Chi-Square value is lower than the lower bound, this means that the standard deviations are too pessimistic. On the other hand, if the Chi-Square value is higher than the upper bound, this can be interpreted in the same way as if the F-Test fails.
