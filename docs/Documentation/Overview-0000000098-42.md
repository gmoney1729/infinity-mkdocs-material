# Overview

### Infrastructure

The infrastructure module allows you to create basic road and tunnel designs as well as convert data from external files that already have a design.

When a design is imported from an external file, the object is created directly. However, you can still edit the information that has been imported with the result of an updated design.

Once a design is ready, Infinity can export it to a format suitable for field use.

Alignment objects:

**Alignment objects:**

An alignment is a line object used to denote the path of a road, railway, tunnel, and so on. A full design requires a 3D alignment in order to serve as centreline and to calculate the rest of the infrastructure elements.

Road objects:

**Road objects:**

A road object consists of a group of stringlines. The stringlines can be defined with a centreline and cross sections or imported from a design file. If imported from a design file it is possible to set one of the stringlines as centreline, which creates an alignment object in the background.

Cross sections:

**Cross sections:**

A cross section is a slice or a cut at a certain chainage of the road. In a vertical view, it indicates the position of a roads material layers.

Stringlines result from interconnecting the nodes of subsequent cross sections.

Material layers:

**Material layers:**

Within Infinity, the material layers represent the different layers of a road and group sets of stringlines that belong to the same level, material or phase of construction and are, therefore, thematically interconnected.

Material surfaces:

**Material surfaces:**

Material surfaces are surfaces that correspond to different material layers of a road object.

Tunnel objects:

**Tunnel objects:**

A tunnel object consists of tunnel profiles assigned at specific chainages along the centreline alignment. It can contain multiple layers and accommodate for superelevation with rotation tables.

Tunnel alignment:

**Tunnel alignment:**

A tunnel alignment serves as the centreline along which the tunnel is built. It references the chainages where tunnel profiles are assigned.

Tunnel layers represent shapes of different materials or phases within a tunnel.

**Tunnel profiles:**

Tunnel profile defines the cross section cut of a tunnel containing shapes of different tunnel layers.

Tunnel sections:

**Tunnel sections:**

Tunnel sections denote continuous segments of tunnel that have a start profile and an end profile assigned at different chainages.

Tunnel rotations:

**Tunnel rotations:**

Tunnel rotations account for the superelevation along the tunnel for different layers at specific chainages.

Infrastructure tool - Roads and alignments:

**Infrastructure tool - Roads and alignments:**

It is the tool that allows for the input and the editing of the different components that lead to a full 3D alignment object. Based on an existing alignment acting as centreline, you can create, edit and view the rest of the elements that lead to a finished road design object.

If any potential conflicts are found, Infinity notifies you.
