# Volume Calculations

### Volume Calculations

For calculating volumes a reference surface, a ground surface and, depending on the selected calculation method, an intersecting plane must be defined.

Reference surfaces:

**Reference surfaces:**

A reference surface is the surface of the stockpile/cavity for which a volume shall be calculated. Cavities are negative stockpiles.

Ground surfaces:

**Ground surfaces:**

A ground surface for simple stockpile computations is the surface at the bottom of the selected stockpile which is created with triangulation among the points which define the outer boundary of the stockpile. For cavities the ground surface is the surface covering the cavity. It is computed in the same way as for stockpiles. If you choose to compute a Surface to Surface volume then the ground surface is the second selected surface (for example, the surface that you select under To Surface in the Surface to Surface method, for further information on this method read the following).

Intersecting planes:

**Intersecting planes:**

To define an intersecting plane for a volume calculation choose a point from your current project or define a height through which a horizontal plane shall be calculated for intersecting the surface. Volumes are calculated above and below the intersecting plane.

Stockpile:

**Stockpile:**

| 1. | Select the    Stockpile option in the Surfaces ribbon bar. A window opens called Volumes: Stockpile. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | In the Input section select the    option to select the Reference Surface for the calculation. |
| 3. | Select the Calculate option at the bottom of the Volumes: Stockpile window to compute the Stockpile Volume. The result is shown to you in a Results section. |

**To Point:**

| 1. | Select the    To Point option in the Surfaces ribbon bar. A window opens called Volumes: Surface to Point. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | In the Input section select the    option to select the Reference Surface for the calculation. |
| 3. | In the From Point section select a point in your project that shall serve as the reference point for calculating the intersecting horizontal plane. |
| 4. | Select the Calculate option at the bottom of the Volumes: Surface to Point window to compute the volume above and below the height of the selected reference point. The result is shown to you in a Results section. |

| --- | --- |
| 2. | In the Input section select the    option to select the Reference Surface for the calculation. |
| 3. | In the Height section enter a height that shall serve as the reference height for calculating the intersecting horizontal plane. |
| 4. | Select the Calculate option at the bottom of the Volumes: Surface to Height window to compute the volume above and below the selected height. The result is shown to you in a Results section. |

**For all four methods you can:**

Select a different Input data and run another volume calculation within the same Volumes window. The result is added on top of the results computed before. Each Results section can be collapsed or closed individually.
