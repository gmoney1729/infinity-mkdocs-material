# Staked Points in Infinity

### Staked Points in Infinity

Make use of Infinity to:

**Make use of Infinity to:**

- Prepare data for use with stakeout applications in the field. Such data can come from imported files including CAD files.
- Import field stakeout application data to a project and view the details in the inspector and the property grid; as well as within specific stakeout reports.

To see the differences in the graphical view the view needs to be zoomed in on single points.

Supported is the import of job data collected with the applications:

**Supported is the import of job data collected with the applications:**

- Stake points
- Stake DTM
- Stake points & DTM
- Stake to line (line, line with slope, grid, segment, segment with slope, quick line)
- Stake road/check road

In Infinity staked points are written to the points library as well as to a library of their own called staked points.

- Staked points are grouped for easy viewing in the **Inspector** > Features tab.
- Stake road/check road results are grouped for easy viewing in the **Inspector** > Infrastructure tab.
- Run a report on selected results either by selecting the **Reports** option in the Home tab or by selecting Report > Staked Points from the context menu.There are additional reports for staked infrastructure and checked infrastructure. You can run them from general list of reports but also from the Infrastructure ribbon bar.

Define the stakeout tolerances in File > Info & Settings. Stakeout results exceeding the tolerances are marked in bold red in the report.

Make design points coming from CAD available for use with stakeout field applications:

**Make design points coming from CAD available for use with stakeout field applications:**

| 1. | Import of the CAD job into Infinity. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Copy the CAD entities to be staked out from CAD into a project. |
| 3. | Export the project for use within the stakeout application in the field. |

To check and document stakeout results import the stakeout job into Infinity.

The aim is to check the stakeout results. The differences between design coordinates and stakeout results can be:

**The aim is to check the stakeout results. The differences between design coordinates and stakeout results can be:**

- Seen in the graphical view.
- Checked in the **Inspector** > Features tab or in the Infrastructure tab under Checks and Stakes.
- Saved in a report.
