### Flythrough Creator

The flythrough creator allows the creation of video with defined flythrough methods like fly along view points, orbit, look around or fly along feature.

To open the flythrough creator, select the    icon in the status bar.

The flythrough creator can stay open while working with Infinity, be shifted to another screen or docked in a preferred window position within the Infinity frame.

| Terminology | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| View Point: | Defined from the camera and look at point position. |
| Camera Position: | Is a place in the space from which you look at the data, for example when rotating around an object, you move the camera position. The camera position is changed by modifying the distance and angle between the camera and look at position. |
| Look at Position: | Defined by the current view (indicated by the rotation pivot point in the centre of the screen), by the current selection (for example a feature like road, line or area) or by a technical point. |
| Camera Angle: | Is the vertical angle of the camera to the data being viewed. Looking straight on is 90°/100 gon, 0° is up and 180°/200 gon is down. |

| 2. | To create a new flythrough, select New… from the Template drop-down list, enter the name and select Save. |
| 3. | To use an existing flythrough, select it from the available list of templates. |

Flythrough using Fly Along View Points:

**Flythrough using Fly Along View Points:**

Fly along view points create flythrough based on the view point positions defined by navigating in the 3D graphical view. To set a new view point navigate to the desired location and select Create a new View Point from current view.

**Create a new View Point from current view**

| 1. | Select the    icon in the status bar to open the Flythrough Creator and select the Fly Along View Points method. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Navigate in the 3D view (by panning, zooming and rotating) to set the desired position and orientation. |
| 3. | Select create New View icon point to store the current position. A temporary indication for the camera position and the look at position appears in the graphical view. |
| 4. | The camera position and the look at position are modified by selecting a new technical point from the list or by manually changing the current view point coordinates. |
| 5. | Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all desired fly along view points are added. |
| 6. | Use play and stop to preview the flythrough. |
| 7. | Modify the available settings to change the flythrough duration, number of frames or to change the direction. |
| 8. | To save the flythrough, define the video format and resolution then select Create. In the export window, select the destination of the flythrough and select Save. |

Flythrough using Orbit:

**Flythrough using Orbit:**

Orbit rotates the camera position 360° around the look at position at the specified distance and vertical angle. The look at position is a current view, selection or technical point.

| 1. | Select the    icon in the status bar to open the Flythrough Creator and select the Orbit method. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Select the Look at Position by defining the current view icon, selection icon or choose a technical point from the list. |
| 3. | Define the distance between the look at point and camera position and the angle. The vertical angle range is between 0 - 180°. For example, an angle of 30° makes the camera look up and an angle of 170° makes the camera look down. |
| 4. | Modify the available settings to change the flythrough duration, number of frames or to change the direction. |
| 5. | To save the flythrough, define the video format and resolution then select Create. In the export window, select the destination of the flythrough and select Save. |

Flythrough using Look Around:

**Flythrough using Look Around:**

Look around fixes the camera position and rotates the view 360° at a specified vertical angle. The camera position is a current view, selection or technical point.

| 1. | Select the    icon in the status bar to open the Flythrough Creator and select the Look Around method. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Select the Camera Position by defining the current view icon, selection icon or choose a technical point from the list. |
| 3. | Define the angle for the look at position. The vertical angle range is between 0 - 180°. For example, an angle of 30° makes the camera look up and an angle of 170° makes the camera look down. |
| 4. | Modify the available settings to change the flythrough duration, number of frames or to change the direction. |
| 5. | To save the flythrough, define the video format and resolution then select Create. In the export window, select the destination of the flythrough and select Save. |

Flythrough using Fly Along Feature:

**Flythrough using Fly Along Feature:**

The fly along feature creates flythrough by moving along a feature such as a line or alignment. The camera position comes from the offset to the look at position feature or the trajectory along a secondary feature.

| 1. | Select the    icon in the status bar to open the Flythrough Creator and select the Fly Along Feature method. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Choose between the Offset and Trajectory method to create the flythrough. |
| 3. | To create a flythrough with the offset method, choose the pen option to select a feature and define the offset for the camera position. The offset for the camera position works similar as the offset for the technical point.The Length offset - The negative value (-) moves the position back and the positive value (+) moves the position forward.The Cross offset - The negative value (-) moves the position to the left and the positive value (+) moves the position to the right.The Up offset - The negative value (-) moves the position down and the positive value (+) moves the position up. |
| 4. | To create a flythrough with the trajectory method, select the pen option and select a feature for the look at trajectory and the camera trajectory. |
| 5. | Modify the available settings to change the flythrough duration, number of frames or to change the direction. |
| 6. | To save the flythrough, define the video format and resolution then select Create. In the export window, select the destination of the flythrough and select Save. |
