# Data

### Data

Here you can select the settings that apply to the data used for GNSS post-processing.

Cut-off angle:

**Cut-off angle:**

The system default is 10°.

Increase the cut-off angle to avoid the noisier low elevation satellites. This would be used if there may be problems in solving of ambiguities to arrive at a phase fixed solution.

Sampling Rate:

**Sampling Rate:**

The system default is to use all recorded data.

Increase the sampling rate to use only subsets of all recorded data.

Decrease the sampling rate when using long observation times to reduce the processing time.

Used Satellites:

**Used Satellites:**

The system default is to use all available satellites.

Select Manual selection and then on the    option to deselect unhealthy satellites.

Ephemeris Type:

**Ephemeris Type:**

The system default is to use broadcast ephemeris.

In order to use precise ephemeris, import the required NOAA/NGS *.sp3 to the project.

The date of the *.sp3 file must correspond to the date of the data to be processed, else Infinity switches back to broadcast automatically.

Download the required *.sp3 file, see Precise Ephemeris.

Antenna Calibration Set:

**Antenna Calibration Set:**

The system default is Leica relative.

Additional calibration sets for non-Leica antennas are offered for selection but can also be downloaded from http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/ANTCAL/. You can do so through the GNSS manager.
