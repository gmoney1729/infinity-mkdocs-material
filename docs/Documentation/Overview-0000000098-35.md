# Overview

### Point Cloud Registration

Point cloud registration, allows for the import of BLK360, RTC360 and RTC360 LT data into Infinity. Individual scan setups and library point clouds can then be registered together, optimised and stored to create a Unified Point Cloud (UPC). Scanning objects in Infinity are accessible from the navigator, inspector, graphical view, property grid and the register tool.

Infinity currently supports registration through visual alignment and by the matching of targets. Targets can be matched to Infinity points (for example, TPS or GNSS observations) to translate the UPC onto a coordinate system.

If necessary, the UPC can be exported from Infinity using various formats for work in third-party applications.
