This service is a cached basemap imagery service consisting of up to 30Â cm of true colour imagery that is updated on an ongoing basis. This service provides a backdrop to your Infinity projects which is a nice way to help visualise, reference and relate to your project data. It can be loaded and displayed in a project and with the Clip Base Map function, downloaded as a georeferenced image and available for export to the field software. This service is provided free of charge for Infinity customers having an active CCP. The software reads from the Infinity Electronic Identification (EID) licence, the information about the maintenance period. When the maintenance period has expired, no access is available to the imagery.
