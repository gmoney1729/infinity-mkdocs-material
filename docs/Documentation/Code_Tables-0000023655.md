# Code Tables

### Code Tables

The code table is to manage the list of code groups, codes, attributes and styling information including layers, blocks and custom line styles.

A codelist can be generated in the code table and transferred to the field software. When measurements are made, the details of the features like codes and attributes, are recorded and stored with the measured point. Everything can be considered a feature, a building, a fence, a road, a bench, or even a tree.

The code table applies automatically the correct style to the imported field data.

Use feature coding to help increase productivity both in the field and the office by:

**Use feature coding to help increase productivity both in the field and the office by:**

- Having features described.
- Visualising the data in the software.
- Simplified CAD export.
