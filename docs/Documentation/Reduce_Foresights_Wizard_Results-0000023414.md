# Reduce Foresights Wizard: Results

### Reduce Foresights Wizard: Results

In the errors section the resulting standard deviations are listed for:

- A single Hz direction in a single set.
- A single V angle in a single set.
- A single slope distance in a single set.

and for

- The reduced Hz direction.
- The reduced vertical angle.
- The reduced slope distance.

With the standard deviations for the reduced observations being the standard deviation for a single observation divided by the square root of the number of sets.

In the targets section each target point is listed with:

- Its reduced values for Hz, V, slope and horizontal distances.
- Its local grid coordinates resulting from the foresights computation.
- The standard deviation calculated from the correction values for each point in all sets.
