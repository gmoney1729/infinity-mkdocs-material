# Overview

### Georeference Images

Infinity supports the display and the creation of georeferenced images. Using these images is a nice way to help visualise, reference and relate your project data.

Georeferenced images are shown as objects in the library and can be set to visible or not visible. It is possible to use many georeferenced images. An existing georeferenced image can be edited and updated with a new transformation.

Georeferenced images are global objects. You can find them under File > Tools > Georeferenced Images (  ).
