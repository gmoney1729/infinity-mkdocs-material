# Alignments

### Alignments

Alignments are defined in the horizontal and/or the vertical profile tabs of the infrastructure manager.

In the horizontal tab, you can also define station equations.

Each horizontal alignment starts at the Point Of Beginning (POB) and is defined with a sequence of geometry elements.

Existing elements can be edited. New elements can be added above or below.

| 1. | Select an element and select Add Above/Below in the Road Design ribbon bar or select Add Above/Below from the context menu.By default straight elements are added. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Edit the element properties. Infinity guides you through which definitions are mandatory response or optional.The graphical view follows your changes. |
| 3. | Select Apply to save your changes to the alignment. |

To enter station equations switch to the equations tab.

| 1. | Select Add Below in the Road Design ribbon bar and enter the Back and Ahead values in the Inspector view. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Select Apply. |

**Add Below**

**Apply**

In the graphical view purple lines (perpendicular to the alignment) indicate in which places along the alignment station equations are defined.

For each cross section assignment, its modified station value is listed in the inspector and in the property grid.

How to define a vertical alignment?

**How to define a vertical alignment?**

Each vertical alignment starts at the Vertical Point Of Beginning (VPOB) and is defined with a sequence of geometry elements.

The procedure of adding elements is the same as for horizontal alignments (see previous information).
