|  | Adjust Level Line opens the level line processing dialog to adjust the heights for the line. |
|  | Join allows you to connect two or more level lines to a single level line. The lines are added in order of selection. |
|  | Split allows you to divide a level line into two individual lines. This is important when considering level loops are not participating in a least squares adjustment. |
|  | Height Observation is used to enter observed height difference between two points. |
|  | Add Turning Points (TP) to Library is used for adding turning points to be used for other project data. |
|  | Remove Adjustment resets the heights of the level line. |
