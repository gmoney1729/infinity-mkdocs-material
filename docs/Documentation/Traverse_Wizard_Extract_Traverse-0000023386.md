# Traverse Wizard: Extract Traverse

### Traverse Wizard: Extract Traverse

| 1. | Identify the new traverse by a unique ID (name). |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Choose the traverse start point from the available setups and    add it to the new traverse. The next possible setups in the traverse are detected automatically and suggested for selection. |
| 3. | If the next setup in the traverse can be identified uniquely press    add again to add the next point.If there is a choice select the next traverse point manually and press    add. |
| 4. | Repeat step 3 until the traverse is complete. |
| 5. | Under Traverse Technique check that the start and end point coordinates are identified correctly. If    Control coordinates are available these coordinates should be taken. If there is a choice for the initial backsight and/or the final foresight, then choose the correct coordinates to be used. |
| 6. | Optional: If reduced measurements are available for one or more of the traverse points from the Sets of Angles or Measure Foresight applications. And if you want the reduced measurements to be taken for the traverse calculation then    check this option at the bottom of the traverse wizard page. |
