# Generation of the Dense Point Cloud

### Generation of the Dense Point Cloud

To create a dense point cloud from an image group, do the following:

**To create a dense point cloud from an image group, do the following:**

| 1. | Highlight the image group. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Select Dense Point Cloud from the Imaging ribbon bar or use the context menu. |
| 3. | Once the dense point cloud process is triggered, the processing task appears in the Task pane of the Imaging tab in the Inspector and in the Task Manager. See Images. |
| 4. | To store the result, highlight the result and select Store from the Imaging ribbon bar or from the context menu. The dense point cloud appears in the View. |

**Store**

The dense point cloud can be filtered according to the settings described in the Image Processing Settings.

To remove a stored dense point cloud result, do the following:

**To remove a stored dense point cloud result, do the following:**

| 1. | Highlight the dense point cloud result. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Select Remove from the Imaging ribbon bar or from the context menu. |

**Remove**

To create a report for the dense point cloud, do the following:

**To create a report for the dense point cloud, do the following:**

| 1. | Highlight the dense point cloud result. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Select Reports and then Dense Point Cloud Report from the Imaging ribbon bar or from the context menu. |

If the images are not oriented or the orientation is computed but not stored. An orientation is computed first and then a dense point cloud is created, based on the computed orientation.

The Dense Point Cloud (DPC) can be also used to:

**The Dense Point Cloud (DPC) can be also used to:**

- Create surfaces, contours and compute volumes.
- Draw features, like lines and areas.
- Measure distances between objects.
