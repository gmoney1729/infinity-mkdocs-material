# Regular

### Regular

Creates a 3D surface. Use this method for clean point cloud data where point cloud density is not constant.

- Uses the meshing parameters minimum/maximum triangle size.

This surface is created following these steps:

- Determines the initial mesh using the minimum triangle size (regular sampling) and maximum triangle size (hole detection).
- Fills holes without adding new points and without using curvature filling.
- Removes spikes to smooth the final mesh.

After creating the surface, it is possible to edit the minimum and the maximum triangle size value from the surface property grid.
