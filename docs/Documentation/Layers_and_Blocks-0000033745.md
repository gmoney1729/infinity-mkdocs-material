# Layers and Blocks

### Layers and Blocks

Blocks are the collection of geometry objects that act as a single object and can be used in a drawing repetitively to represent features. For example, a block can be used to represents a tree or a signpost.

Blocks can have attributes and can only be used for the codes, type point.

Layers are used to define a common style.

Blocks, block attributes and layers can be imported into the code table from DXF/DWG CAD files.

To import blocks and layers:
