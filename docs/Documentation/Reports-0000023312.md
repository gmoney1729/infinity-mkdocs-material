Reports on Data Sources

**Reports on Data Sources**

After importing a Captivate/SmartWorx DBX job, it is possible to run a report to document the imported state of the data source. In some cases editing of the imported data is necessary to fix various field errors or to shift the data from local to grid coordinates. You can run again the Data Source Report to store the edited state of the data source.

| 1. | Run report after import to document the field data as measured. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | After edits have been made run a second report to document the current or final state of the field data. |
