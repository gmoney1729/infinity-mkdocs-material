# Overview

### Features

In the features module, you can manage the thematic information of imported or created data within the current project. Points, lines and areas are features and can have thematic data assigned to them.

Feature coding is used to describe topographical details of features in the field. The code table holds all the thematic and style information that is applicable to the field data in Infinity. Code tables can be created or registered from within the File > Code Table Management.

To apply coding style information to the field data, you can assign a code table to the project while creating a new project or later from within the File > Info & Settings.

Info & Settings

After importing data to the project, use the inspector to view all features collected with or without codes. This is also where you can see if a code was created in the field and is not in the code table.

You can edit a feature code for a single point in the properties.

Feature codes can be managed locally inside a project by the project code manager, which allows you to edit or apply styling. Features in the project, can be edited to have an individual style. All feature code edits made with the project code manager are project-specific.

**Feature Coding**

The coding information is grouped into two groups:

**The coding information is grouped into two groups:**

| Code TableLists the codes that belong to the projects code table.Field CodesLists imported new codes that are not part of the code table.You cannot modify any information in this view. |
| --- |

- **Code Table**Lists the codes that belong to the projects code table.
- **Field Codes**Lists imported new codes that are not part of the code table.

In the Properties window, you can find also coding information for the selected object (point, line and area). The information is divided into Feature, Styling and Code sections. These properties can be changed individually:

**Properties**

- In the **Feature** section, the Layer can be selected or modified to which the object belongs to.
- In the **Styling** section, the line colour, line width and shading colour for lines and areas can be modified.
- In **Code** section, you can assign another code to the object within a code group.

General steps to follow:

**General steps to follow:**

| 1. | Create a Code Table with codes, coding style and layer information including blocks in Infinity. You can also register an existing Code Table. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Export a Code Table to a codelist for a specific instrument and use it during data collection in the field. |
| 3. | Assign a Code Table to your project while creating it. You can assign a Code Table also later on when you miss this step. |
| 4. | Import data to the project. The data is processed based on the assigned Code Table. |
| 5. | Check field data to be correct with the thematic information.If needed then manage codes using the Project Code Manager and export the modified Code Table to the instrument. |
| 6. | Export the data to a DXF/DWG file. |
