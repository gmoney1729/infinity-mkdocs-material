# Sets of Angles Wizard: Sets Review

### Sets of Angles Wizard: Sets Review

In the sets review all used target points are listed.

| 1. | Review the angle observations and measured distances for each target point.When in Step 2 you chose to compute the maximum number of points without using incomplete sets, all those instances of a point, are unavailable for selection that are part of incomplete sets. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Depending on the Tolerance settings, outliers are marked by   . You can adjust the tolerances to your needs either for the current computation run in the same wizard page or globally under Info & Settings > Averaging & Reduction.The tolerance settings can also be changed for single targets once the sets of angles computation is finished. To do so select the    option in the Observation section of the Sets of Angles Target Properties window. The tolerances shown correspond to those last used but can be changed for single targets if necessary. |
| 3. | Exclude outliers from the computation by de-selecting them.When you de-select a target point from one of the sets then the set becomes incomplete and thus be de-activated for all points. At least one set has to remain active to be able to compute reduced measurements. |
| 4. | Select Next to proceed with, Sets of Angles Wizard: Sets of Angles Results. |
