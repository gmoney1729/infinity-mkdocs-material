# Inspect Check Tunnel and Stake Tunnel Application Results

### Stake Tunnel Application Results

To check and document setting out results, import the stake tunnel job into Infinity.

The objective is to archive the field setting out results and to generate reports as necessary.

The differences between design coordinates and setting out results can be:

**The differences between design coordinates and setting out results can be:**

- Seen in the graphical view.
- Checked in the Inspector > Features tab or in the Infrastructure tab under Checks and Stakes.
- Saved in a report.

### Check Tunnel Application Results

To check and document measured as-built tunnel profiles, import the check tunnel job into Infinity.

The check tunnel application can be of two different types:

**The check tunnel application can be of two different types:**

- Discrete points measured in different chainages along the as built tunnel profile and compared to the expected tunnel design for those specific chainages.
- Sequences of points along a profile or along a segment of the profile, automatically measured by the total station and separated by a user-defined distance increment.

The results of the check tunnel tasks can be:

- Seen in the graphical view.
- Checked in the Inspector > Features tab or in the Infrastructure tab under Checks and Stakes.
- Saved in a report.
