The 2.5D meshing method is used to create the material surface.

To create a material surface:

**To create a material surface:**

| 1. | Select a material layer from the Navigator or the Inspector. |
| --- | --- |
| 2. | Select Material Surface from ribbon bar. |

**Material surface method:**

It is possible to select one out of three pre-defined methods for material surface generation.

The method can be selected in the Info & Settings > Infrastructure > Road tab.
