# Overview

### Traverse Wizard

The traverse wizard allows you to build up a traverse from the setups defined in a project. You can also edit existing traverses. It automatically detects which setups are connected by back and foresights and suggests a sequence once you have selected the start point.

It also detects the traverse technique from the selected combination of setups and suggests the start and end point as well as the initial backsight and final foresight.
