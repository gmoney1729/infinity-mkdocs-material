Select the Reference Type you want to compare against (design). Once set, you can choose the feature itself.Not every feature allows a multiple selection.The selection can be done using a pencil flyout or by selecting the Add current selection option. In order to use it, select the required features from the Navigator, Inspector or graphical view, before selecting the option. 3. Select the Measured Type that represents the captured data. Afterwards, choose the required measured features in the same way as the required reference features.The order of adding the data is not relevant.For library points, it is also possible to select multiple points within the pencil flyout. Deselecting points can be done by keeping the Ctrl key pressed and a left-click of the mouse. 4. Under Settings, you can choose to compute only differences or check your data against tolerances.If you select tolerances, specify the upper and lower tolerance values and define a minimum segment distance. Through the segment distance value, you can simplify the tolerance lines.Tolerance lines indicate the areas in the map where material has to be added or removed. These lines can be exported for stakeout, but if they are too detailed the controller might not be able to handle them. 5. Also under the Settings, you can specify the inspection direction - If you want to calculate distances along the height axis or perpendicular to the reference feature. Then the direction is variable and depends on the shape of the reference feature. 6. If the data set you are comparing has large extends, you can limit the range by activating the ignore distances larger than option. Define the maximum distance between the reference and the measured feature.You can also limit point clouds by clipping data or performing a manual selection in the graphical view. 7. Under Styling, define which colours shall be used for indicating above/below values.Default values for Settings and Styling can be defined in the surfaces Parameters option.Select Parameters from the Surfaces ribbon bar to open.These settings are shared with the cut fill map. 8.

The second surface you select is automatically identified as the measured surface. 3. Under Settings select whether you want to compute only height differences or height differences with respect to given tolerance values.If you select Tolerance, specify the upper and lower tolerance values, too and define a Min. Segment Distance. Through the Min. Segment Distance value you can simplify the tolerance lines. The tolerance lines indicate the areas in the map where material has to be cut or filled. These lines can be exported for stake-out, but if they are too detailed the controller might not be able to handle them. 4. Under Styling define which colours shall be used for indicating cut/fill areas.By default, blue is used for volumes that need to be cut and red is used for volumes that need to be filled. Default values for Settings and Styling can be defined in the surfaces Parameters option.Select Parameters from the Surfaces ribbon bar to open.To reset Settings and Styling to the factory defaults go to the File tab &gt; Info &amp; Settings &gt; Surfaces &amp; Contours and select the Defaults option. 5.

In general, a rejected F-Test in combination with a pattern of rejected W-Tests points to a model error. An incidental W-Test rejection points to one or more gross errors or blunders.</p> <p>Since F-Test, W-Test and T-Test are interlinked, it is best to interpret all tests in combination:</p> <p>Since F-Test, W-Test and T-Test are interlinked, it is best to interpret all tests in combination:</p> <ul> <li>A rejected F-Test in combination with a limited number of rejected W-Tests (T-Tests) usually points to one or more gross errors.</li> <li>If the F-Test is rejected and all observations of a specific type (for example all zenith angles) are rejected as well, the problem probably lies within the mathematical model which needs correction or refinement then. For instance, if all W-Tests for the zenith angles are rejected, it could be helpful to include refraction coefficients.</li> <li>If the F-Test is rejected together with most of the W-Test results (without extremes), the problem probably lies within the stochastic model and you can suspect that the input standard deviations are too optimistic. On the other hand, if the F-Test result is well below the critical value and the W-Test (T-Test) results are all close to zero, then the input standard deviations are possibly too pessimistic.</li> </ul> <p>Example:</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>Suppose that the data snooping on the observations in your network results in a (limited) number of rejections.

Thus, it is recommended to process and cross-check as much of the data as possible on site.</li> <li>Increase the standard deviation of the corresponding observationsIncreasing the standard deviation of an observation always works, because it always results in decreasing the F-, W-, T-Test values.

Type The type indicates what sort of data the booking sheet line refers to - Backsight, intermediate or foresight measurements. BS The Backsight Staff (BS) reading. Depending on the observation method you have one or two backsights for one instrument setup.The starting BS measurement for a level line is always a library point and can be edited. IS The Intermediate Staff (IS) readings. These are the points not part of the level line where a height value should be measured. Intermediate points are staff setups which are not part of the line but included in the line processing.The IS measurements are always library points and can be renamed. FS The Foresight Staff (FS) reading. Depending on the observation method, you have one or two foresights for one instrument setup.FS measurements are not library points by default. Rise When the BS - FS is positive. Fall When the BS - FS is negative. Hz Dist Distance between the level instrument and staff 1/2. Ideally the distances should be the same to cancel errors due to curvature and refraction. Azimuth For some XML imported level data there can exist preliminary coordinates and azimuth directions from the level stations to the BS-FS. Easting If the Easting has been recorded it can be displayed in the booking sheet. Northing If the Northing has been recorded it can be displayed in the booking sheet. Height The height of a point as calculated in relation to the start height. Control heights are fixed, while measured heights are updated when a level line is processed. SD This column shows the Standard Deviation (SD) of an observation recorded in repeat single, mean, mean+s or median measure mode. To edit one or more SD highlight one or more staff reading and select Edit Standard Deviations from the context menu. Mean SD The Mean Standard Deviation (Mean SD) is the mean of all the standard deviations calculated in the level line up to that point. It can be used for finding the average variation in the measurements, rather than the variation for each observation. Measurements Is the number of measurements taken by the instrument for that observation. This is displayed for measurement modes repeat single, mean, mean+s and median. Spread The spread is the difference between the highest and lowest observations in repeat single, mean, mean+s or median measure modes. Mode The measure mode indicates how the observations were taken. Most levels have single, repeat single, mean, mean+s and median measure modes. Diff BS1-BS2 For BF sequence measurements the difference between the first and second backsights is recorded. Ideally the difference should be 0. Diff FS1-FS2 For BF sequence measurements the difference between the first and second foresights is recorded. Ideally the difference should be 0. Station Diff The Station Difference (Station Diff) is used for BFFB (and aBFFB) sequence measurements. It is the sum of the differences in the backsights and foresights. Total Station Diff The Total Station Difference (Total Station Diff) is a running total of the station differences for every station in the level line up until that point. Dist Balance The distance balance is the difference between the distance to the backsight point and the foresight point. Total Dist Balance The total station difference is a running total of the station differences for every station in the level line up until that point. Earth Curv Corr Indicates whether the Earth Curvature Correction (Earth Curv Corr) has been applied to the observations. Expansion Coefficient The expansion coefficient is the value used when applying staff corrections during line processing. This value varies depending on the type of staff used.

Instead, we use the observations to determine unknown parameters, for example the coordinates of stations in a network. The observations are expressed as a function of the parameters in a so-called functional or mathematical model.</p> <p>In some cases, the model representing the relations between the observations and the unknown parameters is simple. The relation, for example, in a one-dimensional leveling problem between the observed height differences and the unknown heights is linear:</p> <p></p> <p>More complicated is the case for a GPS network where the unknowns are coordinates (X,Y,Z) to be determined in a reference system different from that of the observed baselines \u0394X:</p> <p></p> <p>With \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3,\u03bc = transformation parameters</p> <p>As the least squares approach requires linear equations, the complex model above must be linearised. Usually this means that a number of iterations are needed to reach a solution. Moreover, approximate values for the coordinate unknowns in the adjustment are required. Bad approximate values can lead to an increasing number of iterations or, in the worst case, to no convergence at all.</p> <p>Nuisance parameters</p> <p>Nuisance parameters</p> <p>Since coordinates are our main concern, other unknowns in the mathematical model are not always useful for us. Unknowns such as the transformation parameters mentioned above, are called additional or nuisance parameters. Typical nuisance parameters are: transformation parameters, scale factors, azimuth offsets, orientation unknowns and refraction coefficients. Some of these parameters can be kept fixed at a certain value, which makes them not be corrected in the adjustment. Whether or not to keep parameters fixed is a question which cannot easily be answered. We must always be careful to avoid over constraining as well as not to over parameterise. The introduction of refraction coefficients, for example, could result in the absorption of systematic effects which are not caused by refraction. However, ignoring the refraction, when in fact it does have an influence on the measurements, causes an equally unfavourable effect. The success of what could be referred to as tuning of the model depends largely on the expertise.</p> <p>Another typical nuisance parameter is the scale factor which may be estimated for distance measurements. The aim of introducing a free scale factor in the adjustment is to overcome a possible bias in the internal scale of the measurement equipment and, in more general terms, to prevent the over constraining of the network in a free adjustment. A free scale factor shrinks or blows up the network in order to make it fit to the known stations in constrained adjustments. As a result, in some situations a free scale factor may obstruct the statistical testing of known stations: An outlier in the coordinates of a known station could remain undetected when, due to the shrink or blow up effect, the network is forced to fit to the known stations without any rejections. The outlier is absorbed by the scale factor, which then has a value distinctly different from 1.0. It is, therefore, recommended to examine the value of the scale factor after the adjustment and, in case of doubt, to rerun the adjustment with a fixed scale.</p> <p>Singularity</p> <p>Singularity</p> <p>An adjustment fails when the mathematical model, as represented by the design matrix and normal matrix, is singular.</p> <p>Singularity is caused by:</p> <p>Singularity is caused by:</p> <ul> <li>An ill-posed problem.</li> <li>An improperly formulated model.</li> </ul> <p>A problem may be ill-posed because we expect too much from the observations, or because not enough observations are included. An example of an ill-posed problem is the determination of the 2D coordinates of an unknown station by a single horizontal direction from another station.</p> <p>A model is improperly formulated, when too many parameters are included. In general, an improperly formulated model does not correctly represent the existing physical reality.</p> <p>Additionally, the ill-conditioning of the normal matrix N could result in singularity, a problem which occurs especially with computerised solutions to least squares problems. An ill-conditioned matrix can become singular as a result of the internal accuracy limits of the computer hardware. An example of an ill-conditioned problem is the intersection of a station by two or more nearly parallel directions.</p> <p>Minimum number of constraints</p> <p>Minimum number of constraints</p> <p>Apart from the problems mentioned above, an adjustment of terrestrial observations cannot be solved unless the location, orientation and scale of the network are established, that is, a datum must be defined. This is done by imposing constraints on the solution. The minimum number of constraints depends on the dimension of the network:</p> <p>In a 3D network, there are three translations, three rotations and one scale factor. The singularity is then eliminated by fixing at least seven coordinates of three stations (Lat1, Lon1, h1, Lat2, Lon2, h2, h3).</p>"},{"location":"Documentation/Measure_Point_to_Point-0000023357/","title":"Measure Point to Point","text":""},{"location":"Documentation/Measure_Point_to_Point-0000023357/#measure-point-to-point_1","title":"Measure Point to Point","text":"<p>Measure point to point is a COGO function and can be used to determine horizontal and vertical angle differences as well as horizontal and slope distance differences between two points in your project.

Lines A line is used to describe feature objects by drawing a line between two or more points. Areas An area is a closed line object. Setups A setup is the source of any measurement observation. Observations An observation is the measurement that defines the source of a point. GNSS Tracks A GNSS track is an object resulting from processing moving or mixed data. Traverses A traverse is a series of intervisible points at which angles are measured and also distances can be measured, to determine the station setups. Sets of Angles A set of angles are a series of observations that are reduced to an angular value. The angular value is then coordinated from the source of the observations. Surfaces A surface is a triangulation network representing points, cloud points, lines and areas. Point Cloud Groups A point cloud group is a defined group of point clouds that represents a single object, used for cleaning or surface creation. Point Clouds A point cloud is a measurement object from the data source. Image Groups An image group is a defined group of images that you can measure image points from. Images An image is a picture captured that is represented by its position or object it is assigned to. Georeferenced Images An image that has been ortho-rectified and can be placed in the project coordinate reference frame. Alignments The alignment is a linear object made of multiple segments geometrically defined and joined together.It defines the route of a road construction, generally its centreline or axis. Roads A road is made of several objects including a centreline and a material layer. The material layer describes the stringlines assigned to it. Material Layers Are the layers constituting a road. A material layer groups a set of stringlines that belong to the same level, material or phase of construction. Cross Sections A cross section is a slice or cut at a certain chainage of the road, displaying the position of different linear features connected together in a cross section view. Cross Section Assignments Result from cross sections templates being assigned to a road. Stringlines result from interconnecting cross section assignments. Stringlines Are special line objects that can either be imported from CAD or defined through cross section assignment. Scan Setup A setup belonging to a BLK360, RTC360 or RTC360LT. Scan Group A group of scan setups that have been joined together by links. Registration Link A line shown between two scan setups to symbolise that they have been joined by visual alignment or target matching. Used Registration Target A target that has been used to join setups by target matching.

If the previously mentioned requirements for images and coordinate system are fulfilled, images camera poses should be shown in the view.

For further information, see Marking of Control Points. 6. To store the orientation result, highlight it and select Store from the Imaging ribbon bar or from the context menu. The sparse point cloud appears in the view. Together with the orientation of the images, Infinity computes the 3D position of the common features that were matched and used for orientation, also called tie points. These points form a sparse point cloud. This point cloud shows a rough representation of the area, that is reconstructed during the dense point cloud computation.

A stochastic variable cannot be described by a single and exact value because there is an amount of uncertainty involved in the measurement process. For example, repeatedly measuring the distance between two stations results in a range of different values. This variation is accounted for by a probability distribution. This means that in addition to the mathematical model, it is necessary to formulate a second model which describes the stochastic deviations of the observations; the stochastic model.</p> <p>For geodetic observations a normal probability distribution is assumed (see the following). The distribution is based on the mean \u03bc and the standard deviation \u03c3.</p> <p></p> <p>The mean \u03bc represents the value of the mathematical expectation of the observable. The standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion or spread of the probability. The standard deviation characterises the precision of the observation. The square of \u03c3 is called the variance. By definition there is a 0.684 probability that normally distributed stochastic variables fall within a window limited by -\u03c3 and +\u03c3. For a window limited by -2\u03c3 and +2\u03c3 this probability is 0.954. In general, the probability that a stochastic variable takes a value between x1 and x2 is equal to the area enclosed by the curve, and the x1 and x2 ordinates. This is the shaded area in the diagram above.</p> <p>Correlation of observations</p> <p>Correlation of observations</p> <p>It is possible for two or more observations to be interdependent or correlated. This means that a deviation in one observation influences the other. The correlation between two observations x and y is mathematically expressed by the covariance \u03c3xy. The covariance is also used in the correlation coefficient, defined as:</p> <p></p> <p>The coefficient takes values between minus and plus one:</p> <p>The coefficient takes values between minus and plus one:</p> <p>-1 \u2264 \u03c1  \u2264 1</p> <p>If the observations are not interdependent it follows that \u03c1= 0. The vector elements (DX,DY,DZ) of a GPS baseline are an example for correlated observations. To express this correlation a 3x3 matrix is used. This symmetric matrix is a combination of standard deviations and correlation coefficients:</p> <p></p> <p>Sigma a priori</p> <p>Sigma a priori</p> <p>In essence the stochastic model consists of a choice for the probability distribution of the observations. Practically this means that for each observation a standard deviation \u03c3 is chosen. The value for s is based on knowledge about the measurement process (conditions in the field, type of instrument) and experience. The standard deviation of most observation is supposed to consist of an absolute part, and a relative part. In the relative part the dependence on the distance between station and target, which characterises the precision of most observations, is accounted for. The standard deviations are entered in the variance-covariance matrix \u03a3b. The precision of the unknowns in the adjustment depends on the precision of the observations given in \u03a3b, and on the propagation of this precision by the mathematical model.</p>"},{"location":"Documentation/Surface_Contours-0000023476/","title":"Surface Contours","text":""},{"location":"Documentation/Surface_Contours-0000023476/#surface-contours_1","title":"Surface Contours","text":"<p>It is possible to create contours for a selected surface.</p> <ul> <li>Select a surface.</li> <li>From the ribbon bar, select Contour.</li> <li>From the Create Contour window, edit the settings to define the contour display.</li> </ul> <p>Create Contour</p> <p>Create Contour</p> <p>When creating a set of contours for a surface the following settings must be considered:</p> <p>When creating a set of contours for a surface the following settings must be considered:</p> <p>Surface</p> <p>Surface</p> <ul> <li>Displays the selected surface including the height details.</li> </ul> <p>Contours</p> <p>Contours</p> <p>Set the values to determine the drawing of the contour:</p> <p>Set the values to determine the drawing of the contour:</p> <ul> <li>Minor Interval, defines the distance between minor contours that are drawn.</li> <li>Major Frequency, defines when the major contour is drawn.

This hypothesis assumes that there is just one erroneous observation at a time. This so-called data snooping works very well for single observations, for example for directions, distances, zenith angles, azimuths or height differences. However, for some observations such as GPS baselines, it is not enough to test the DX-, DY-, DZ-components of each vector separately. It is imperative to test the baseline as a whole as well.</p> <p>For this purpose we introduce the T-Test. Depending on the dimension of the quantity to be tested, the T-Test is a 3- or 2-dimensional test. As with the W-Test, the T-Test is also interlinked with the F-Test by the B-Method of testing. The T-Test has the same power as both other tests, but has its own levels of significance and its own critical values (see tables below).</p> <p>Significance level/critical value for 2-dimensional T-Test, based on \u03b10 of the W-Test:</p> <p>Significance level/critical value for 2-dimensional T-Test, based on \u03b10 of the W-Test:</p> significance level \u03b10 0.001 0.010 0.050 significance level \u03b1 (2-dim) 0.003 0.022 0.089 critical value T-Test 5.91 3.81 2.42 <p>significance level \u03b10</p> <p>significance level \u03b1 (2-dim)</p> <p>critical value T-Test</p> <p>Significance level/critical value for 3-dimensional T-Test, based on a0 of the W-Test:</p> <p>Significance level/critical value for 3-dimensional T-Test, based on a0 of the W-Test:</p> significance level \u03b10 0.001 0.010 0.050 significance level \u03b1 (3-dim) 0.005 0.037 0.129 critical value T-Test 4.24 2.83 1.89 <p>significance level \u03b10</p> <p>significance level \u03b1 (3-dim)</p> <p>critical value T-Test</p> <p>The T-Test is equally useful when you want to test for slight deformations on known stations. The data snooping successfully finds an outlier that might have occurred, for example, due to a typing error in either the Easting or the Northing or the height component causing a gross error in one of the coordinate components. But the deformation of a whole station might stay undetected by the data snooping when the shifts caused by the deformation in each coordinate component are relatively small. For testing a possible deformation influencing the whole coordinate triplet, like with the Easting and the Northing and the height, a different alternative hypothesis is needed. The 3-dimensional T-Test on the complete coordinate triplet is better equipped to trace the deformation, although its not able to trace the exact direction into which the station has moved.</p> <p></p> <p>A situation in which the W-Test is accepted but the associated T-Test of the observation is rejected, which is not unlikely in practice, does not necessarily imply a contradiction.

Thus, in case the null-hypothesis is rejected, other hypotheses must be formulated if you want to describe a possible error or a combination of errors.</p> <p>There is an infinite number of hypotheses which you could formulate as an alternative for the null-hypothesis. But the more complex these hypotheses become the more difficult they are to interpret. A simple but effective hypothesis, though, is the so-called conventional alternative hypothesis, based on the assumption that you have to suspect an outlier in only one observation while all others are correct. The one-dimensional test associated with this hypothesis is called W-Test.</p> <p>The assumption that just a single outlier corrupts your network is, indeed realistic. A strong rejection of the F-Test can often be traced back to a gross error in just one observation. The conventional alternative hypothesis for each observation implies that each individual observation is tested. The process of testing each observation in a network by a W-Test is called data snooping.</p> <p>Often the size of the least squares correction alone is not precise enough to indicate an outlier when you check the observations in your network. A better test quantity, though only suited for uncorrelated observations, is the least squares correction divided by its standard deviation. For correlated observations, like for example the three coordinate elements of a baseline, the complete weight matrix of the observations must be taken into account. This condition is fulfilled with the test quantity W of the W-Test, which has a standard normal distribution and is most sensitive to errors in one of the observations.</p> <p>The critical value Wcrit depends on your choice of the significance level \u03b10. If the W-Test is rejected because of W&gt;Wcrit, there is a probability of 1-\u03b10 that the corresponding observation indeed holds an outlier. On the other hand, there is a probability of \u03b10 that the observation does not hold an outlier, which implies that the rejection was unjustified. In geodesy, values for \u03b10 between 0.001 and 0.05 are most commonly used. The following table gives you an overview on the \u03b10-values and their corresponding critical values. Which \u03b10 you effectively choose depending on how strict and rigid you intend to test your observations. A strict testing (with a small critical value), leads to a larger \u03b10 and therefore, to an increased probability to reject valid observations. An \u03b10 value of 0.001 implies one false rejection in every 1000 observations. This has proven to be a realistic choice.</p> significance level \u03b10 0.001 0.010 0.050 critical value W-Test 3.29 2.58 1.96 <p>significance level \u03b10</p> <p>critical value W-Test</p> <p>Essential for a successful testing by the B-Method is that an outlier is detected with the same probability by both the F-Test and the W-Test. To achieve this, the test power \u03b2 is by default fixed on a level of usually 0.80 for both tests. You can adapt \u03b2 by 10% up or down in the settings for the test criteria. The W-Test level of significance \u03b10 is selected, to which leaves the F-Test level of significance \u03b1 to be determined. With \u03b10 and \u03b2 being fixed, \u03b1 strongly depends on the redundancy in the network and increases for large networks with many observations and a considerable amount of redundancy. In such networks, it becomes difficult for the F-Test to react on a single outlier. The F-Test, being an overall model test, is not sensitive enough to achieve this task. Thus, it is common practice to do data snooping, no matter what the result of the F-Test might be.</p> <p>See also:</p> <p>See also:</p> <p>Test Criteria</p>"},{"location":"Documentation/Welcome-0000031962/","title":"Welcome","text":""},{"location":"Documentation/Welcome-0000031962/#welcome_1","title":"Welcome","text":"<p>In welcome you see:</p> <p>In welcome you see:</p> <p></p> No. Name Description 1.
